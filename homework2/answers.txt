Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

Before fixing a code:
Sample1 - GC-content: 0.43029262963

After fixing a code:
Sample1 - GC-content: 0.430599870611

Problem 3:

a. An error occurs after commenting out "gc_count = 0". The error is caused by a nameerror which indicates that name "gc_count = 0" is not defined. Thus, the loop cannot work well when using "gc_count = 0".
   
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 93, in <module>
    gc_count = gc_count + 1
NameError: name 'gc_count' is not defined

b. This answer is very similary with previous answer (a). A name error occurs when commenting out "nucleotides = filename_to_string(filename)" because the name nucleotides is not defiend when running a loop below.
 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 89, in <module>
    for base in nucleotides:
NameError: name 'nucleotides' is not defined

Total count: 27000000
Length of nucleotides: 27000000

Sample 2
Sum of G+C+A+T 26977435
Total count: 27000000
Length of nucleotides: 27000000

Sample 3
Sum of G+C+A+T 9510883
Total count: 9510928
Length of nucleotides: 9510928

Sample 4
Sum of G+C+A+T 9980961
Total count: 9981008
Length of nucleotides: 9981008

Sample 5
Sum of G+C+A+T 75
Total count: 76
Length of nucleotides: 76

Sample 6
Sum of G+C+A+T 26990
Total count: 27000
Length of nucleotides: 27000

test-high-gc-1
Sum of G+C+A+T 39840
Total count: 40000
Length of nucleotides: 40000

test-high-gc-2
Sum of G+C+A+T 39841
Total count: 40000
Length of nucleotides: 40000

test-moderate-gc-1
Sum of G+C+A+T 39841
Total count: 40000
Length of nucleotides: 40000

test-moderate-gc-2
Sum of G+C+A+T 39811
Total count: 40000
Length of nucleotides: 40000

All ".fastq" files may include not only G, C, A, and T nucleotides, but also other types of nucleotides. Thus, there are dffierences between "Sum of G+C+A+T" and "Total count"/"Length of nucleotides".

In addition, when computing GC content, we need to use "Sum of G+C+A+T", not "Total count" and "Length of nucleotides" because this gives us more exact the GC countent. 

Therefore, my program incorrecticly computed the GC_content as well as AT content because my program used "Total count" as a denominator. 

Problem 7:

Sample 1
AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747

Problem 8:

Sample 1
GC-content: 0.430599870611
GC Classification: moderate

Collaboration:
