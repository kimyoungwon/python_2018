Answer to Problem 7:

The data suggest that I can reject the null hypothesis; the Iranian election results were fraudulent. The null hypothesis rejection level(p) of 2009 Iranian election was over 0.95 on average, which is much higher than the threshold for statistical significance, p = 0.05; the higher p is, the more faudulent data. This means that more than 95% of genuine elections were as different from the uniform distribution as the Iranian election was: 95% confident that the data are fraudulent.

Answer to Problem 8:

The results tell that I cannot reject the null hypothesis; US election was not fraudulent. The null hypothesis rejection level(p) of 2008 US election was around 0.05 on average, which is very close to the threshold for statistical significance, p = 0.05. This means only about 5% of genuine elections were as different from the uniform distribution as the US electionw was; only 5% confident that the data are fraudulent.
